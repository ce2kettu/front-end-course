## Introduction and motivation

### Motivation
At the time of writing it has been more than 3 years since the last time I have done any sort of front-end web development. And not soon after having started the project, I began to slowly recall why I enjoy doing this type of work. I feel like it's just so fulfilling being able to express yourself on a blank canvas. Though I must say that I, to this point, cannot draw for shit, but I feel like this is a great complement if anything.
The project idea was actually already in place before starting this course. So, being able to create and design my own project together with a course that merits study credits was a welcomed addition. :)
Also, this project really freshened up my memory about web development and the whole process of spending 5 hours to find the best color for an element...

### Introduction
The scope of the project was to create a new look and feel to the Aalef website we know and love (?). You can check out the website [here](https://aalef.fi/) if you are not familiar with it. Aalef Ltd. provides e.g., lunch and bookstore services for students on the LUT-University campus. I felt discouraged by not using any frameworks (like bro do I really want to copy paste my footer on every page?) and hence did not put my best effort into the project. (I also don't have the time)
_and I still kind of went overboard with the project, but you know, at least I had my fun._

## Installation and development

#### Setup
`git clone https://github.com/ce2kettu/front-end-course.git`

— and well that's kind of it. Just open the `course-project/dist/index.html` file in your preferred browser and you're good to go.

#### Watch sass
`npm run sass`

I also recommend using something like nodemon to refresh the page every time a change is made to HTML files.

#### Deploy to gh-pages
`npm run deploy`
